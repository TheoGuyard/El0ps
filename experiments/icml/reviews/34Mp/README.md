The file `sensibility_reltol.pdf` presents a similar experiment to that in Figure 4 of our paper, but where we vary the accuracy targeted while solving the relaxation across the BnB tree.
More precisely, this accuracy $\epsilon$ corresponds to the relative optimality tolerance of the first-order method solving $(\mathcal{R}^{\nu}$).
We remark a slight variation in the acceleration provided by our simultaneous pruning methodology.
